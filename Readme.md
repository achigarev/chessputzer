**Chessputzer** recognizes chess positions. Use the [web interface](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/putz/).

For best results, include the border of the chessboard and crop close to it. If parts of the diagram are blurry or too hard to read, the algorithm makes the best guess based on the other pieces on the board. Please let me know if you have examples of books and images that don't work well.

Have fun!

**Chessputzer** was inspired by [Fenbot](https://github.com/Elucidation/tensorflow_chessbot) but the internals are quite different. It is designed for scanned images with noise and artifacts.  So we do much less, but tolerate much more.
