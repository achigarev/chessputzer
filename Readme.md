**Chessputzer** is designed to recognize positions from books and magazines. Use the [web interface](https://www.ocf.io/abhishek/putz).

For best results, make sure that you include the border of the chessboard and crop close to it.If parts of the diagram are blurry or too hard to read, the algorithm makes the best guess instead of giving up. You can always correct mistakes in the [Lichess](http://lichess.org) link. 

Please let me know if you have examples of books and images that don't work well.  **Note**: the program is intended for fonts that usually appear in published works. Images created by chess software will not work. 

Have fun!

**Chessputzer** was inspired by [Fenbot](https://github.com/Elucidation/tensorflow_chessbot) but designed for scanned images with noise and artifacts.  So we do much less, but tolerate much more.
